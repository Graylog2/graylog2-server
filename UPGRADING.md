## Breaking Changes

## API Endpoint Deprecations

The following API endpoints are deprecated beginning with 4.4.

| Endpoint                                    | Description                 |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `PUT /example/placeholder`                  | TODO placeholder comment    |

## API Endpoint Removals

The following API endpoints have been removed in 4.4.

| Endpoint                                    | Description                 |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `PUT /example/placeholder`                  | TODO placeholder comment    |

## Behaviour Changes

- The system messages collection in MongoDB will be created as a 50MB capped collection going forward.
  This happens at creation, so existing system messages collections remain unconstrained.

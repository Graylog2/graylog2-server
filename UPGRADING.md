Upgrading to Graylog 6.0.x
==========================

## Breaking Changes

- Default value for `data_dir` configuration option has been removed and must be specified in `graylog.conf`.
- All plugins must be adjusted to work with Graylog 6.x. **Incompatible plugins will break the server startup.**
  Detailed descriptions about Java API changes below.

### Changed default number of process-buffer and output-buffer processors

The default values for the configuration settings `processbuffer_processors` and `outputbuffer_processors` have been
changed. The values will now be calculated based on the number of CPU cores available to the JVM. If you have not
explicitly set values for these settings in your configuration file, the new defaults apply.

The new defaults should improve performance of your system, however, if you want to continue running your system with
the previous defaults, please add the following settings to your configuration file:

```
processbuffer_processors = 5
outputbuffer_processors = 3
```

### Prometheus metrics

The name of the `jvm_classes_loaded` metric [has been changed](https://github.com/prometheus/client_java/pull/681).

Prometheus queries referencing `jvm_classes_loaded` need to be adapted to
the new name `jvm_classes_currently_loaded`.

### Authentication required to use API browser

Users now have to log in before visiting the API browser. It is sufficient to log in with any user known to Graylog. No
particular permissions are required.

The username/password field was removed from the header of the API browser. If users want to perform API requests with
different credentials, they must log out of Graylog and re-login with another user.

### Plugins

Removal of `systemnavigation` web interface plugin. Previously it was possible to register options for the
system dropdown in the navigation, by using the `systemnavigation` plugin.
Now this can be achieved by registering a `navigation` plugin.
The plugin entity needs the `description` `System` and `children` (array).
Every child represents a dropdown option and needs a `path` and `description` attribute.

### Template language change

Graylog uses JMTE for a variety of templates (see below for a list of affected features). This library has been updated
to version 7.0.2, which contains a breaking change, potentially affecting user generated templates.

Previously an if statement in a template could compare a property to an unquoted string. This is no longer possible and will
likely result in an error:

Valid before: ${if property=somestring}
Must be changed to: ${if property='somestring'}

No default templates used this form, and no examples using this syntax were provided, so impact is likely to be minimal.

Templates using the JMTE library are potentially affected and should to be checked for compatibility:
* Decorators on search results
* Custom event fields
* HTTP event notifications
* Script event notifications
* Slack event notifications
* MS Teams event notifications
* Archive directory naming
* HTTP JsonPath lookup table adapter

Not affected by this change are the following templates using Freemarker:
* Sidecar configurations

### Enterprise theme customization

In case you are using the enterprise customization feature, you might need to adjust the newly added `gray` color on the customization page, due to some theme structure changes.   
This should just affect the input and table header colors, other colors should look like before the upgrade.  

## Configuration File Changes
| Option                           | Action    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|----------------------------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `disabled_retention_strategies`  | **added** | Disables the specified retention strategies. By default, strategies `none` and `close` are now disabled in new installations.<br/>Strategies can be re-enabled simply by removing from this list.<br/>**Do not extend this list on existing installs!** |
| `field_value_suggestion_mode`    | **added** | Allows controlling field value suggestions, turning them on, off, or allowing them only for textual fields.                                                                                                                                             |


## Asset Import Changes

Graylog 5.2 introduced the Assets feature and the ability to import Assets from Active Directory.
Previously Graylog users could define any AD attribute to map to a Graylog Asset's User ID field.

This functionality has been amended to only allow the Active Directory SID attribute for AD User Asset import mapping configurations,
to better align with the GIM schema and allow for targeted handling of AD SIDs.

Any existing Active Directory User Asset import configurations will be automatically updated to use the SID as the Unique ID attribute, potentially changing the behavior of subsequent imports by those configurations.

## Input log parsing changes

Log parsing changes have been made several inputs in preparation for Illuminate parsing content. Note that additional 
message parsing for these inputs is expected to be released in an upcoming release of Graylog Illuminate.

### AWS Security Lake input

## Newly Stored Message Fields

The following fields will be added to every Message.
The data of the fields is *not* accounted as outgoing traffic.

 - `gl2_receive_timestamp` - The time the Message was received
 - `gl2_processing_timestamp` - The time the Message was processed and will be sent to an Output
 - `gl2_processing_duration_ms` - The duration between the receive and processing times


## Java API Changes

The following Java Code API changes have been made.

| `org.graylog2.plugin.Message(String, Map<String, Object>)`                      | Constructor became package-private              |
| `org.graylog2.plugin.Message#addStringFields`                                   | Deprecated method removed                       |

### Message Factory

New `org.graylog2.plugin.Message` instances must now be created by using a `org.graylog2.plugin.MessageFactory` method.

The previous constructors on `Message` are now package-private and can't be accessed by code in other packages anymore.
The package-private constructors in `Message` might change in any release and are not considered a stable API anymore.

Code that creates messages must now inject a `MessageFactory` and use one of the `createMessage()` methods
to create new `Message` instances.

### Transition from the `javax` to the `jakarta` namespace

Graylog was using various annotations from the `javax.*` packages, e.g. to annotate REST
resources or to facilitate dependency injection. The package name for some of these
annotations has been changed to `jakarta.*`. For a plugin to keep working as expected,
its code needs to be adjusted to also use the new package names.

| previous name               | new name                      |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `javax.annotation.Priority` | `jakarta.annotation.Priority` |
| `javax.inject.*`            | `jakarta.inject.*`            |
| `javax.validation.*`        | `jakarta.validation.*`        |
| `javax.ws.rs.*`             | `jakarta.ws.rs.*`             |

### Removal of Mongojack 2 dependency

The Java dependency on the Mongojack 2 library was removed and replaced with a
compatibility layer. Plugins that interact with MongoDB might need to be
modified if they use Mongojack functionality that is not commonly used
throughout the Graylog core code base.

## REST API Endpoint Changes

The following REST API changes have been made.

| Endpoint                | Description              |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| `GET /example/resource` | TODO placeholder comment |

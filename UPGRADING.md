Upgrading to Graylog 6.1.x
==========================

## Breaking Changes

- API errors which are related to invalid requests (e.g. JSON parsing failures, invalid types, etc.) are now responded to with a type of `RequestError` instead of `APIError`.
- Removed GreyNoise Community Data Adapter deprecated in 5.2.

## Default Configuration Changes

- The `default_message_output_class` setting changed from
`org.graylog2.outputs.BlockingBatchedESOutput` to 
`org.graylog2.outputs.BatchedMessageFilterOutput` as part of an internal
refactoring. Regular users should not change the setting.

- The `output_batch_size` setting can now be configured by providing a byte-based value, e.g. `10 mb`. For backward
compatibility, the default value is still count-based (`500`). Previously configured count-based values are
still supported.

## Java API Changes

The following Java Code API changes have been made.

| File/method                         | Description            |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------|

Upgrading to Graylog 5.2.x
==========================

## New Functionality

- New pipeline rule functions for manipulating maps: `map_set` and `map_remove`.

## Breaking Changes
- If you use the DataNode, the system clocks of the nodes have to be synchronized with an external source for JWT usage (within a margin of a couple of seconds).

### Migrating from legacy index templates to composable index templates

Starting with Graylog 5.2, we are migrating from using [legacy index templates](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/indices-templates-v1.html) to [composable index template]
(https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/index-templates.html). While this gives us more flexibility and predictability for field types in index mappings, this also requires that existing custom legacy index templates need to be migrated to composable index templates manually as well.

### Removed support for legacy "Collector Sidecars"

Graylog 3.0 introduced "Graylog Sidecars" as a replacement for the old Collector Sidecars (version 0.1.x).

With Graylog 5.2, support for the legacy Collector Sidecars is finally removed.

Please refer to the migration guide [Upgrading from the Collector Sidecar](https://archivedocs.graylog.org/en/3.3/pages/sidecar.html#upgrading-from-the-collector-sidecar) if you are still using the old Sidecars before upgrading Graylog to 5.2.

## Deprecation and Change in Functionality of GreyNoise Data Adapters

- GreyNoise Community IP Lookup Data Adapters have been marked as deprecated. Existing Data Adapters can no longer be
  started or lookups performed.
- GreyNoise Full IP Lookup [Enterprise] Data Adapter can no longer be used with a free GreyNoise Community API tokens.
- GreyNoise Quick IP Lookup Data Adapter can no longer be used with a free GreyNoise Community API tokens.

## Shutdown of Graylog on OutOfMemoryError
Because of an error in HttpCore 4.4.12, which is required by Elasticsearch and older versions of Opensearch, OutOfMemoryError errors were not properly handled.
The Reactor was stopped, which prevented proper Graylog operation and the reason (OutOfMemoryError) was not clearly visible.
From now on, Graylog will shutdown on OutOfMemoryError, trying to log some basic information about the thread and memory consumption during this event.

## Input log parsing changes

Log parsing changes have been made several inputs in preparation for Illuminate parsing content. Note that additional 
message parsing for these inputs is expected to be released in an upcoming release of Graylog Illuminate.

Added fields:
- `event_created`: Contains the `time` log value.
- `event_source_input`: Contains the static value `aws_security_lake`.
- `vendor_event_description`: Contains the value which was previously present in the `message` log field.
- `vendor_version`: Contains the `metadata.product.version` log value.

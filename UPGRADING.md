Upgrading to Graylog 7.2.x
==========================

## Breaking Changes

### Paginated REST APIs: Case-Insensitive Matching and Sorting

Paginated entity endpoints (e.g. Streams, Event Definitions, Notifications, Lookup Tables, Dashboards,
Sigma Rules, Investigations, etc.) now share a case-insensitive, numeric-aware collation for both
**sorting** and **filtering**. Previously, only sort order was affected when individual endpoints
opted in; matching was always case-sensitive.

After upgrading:

- Sorting by string fields such as `title` or `name` interleaves upper- and lower-case entries,
  and strings containing numbers sort naturally (`Stream 2` before `Stream 10`).
- Filter expressions on string fields match case-insensitively. For example, a query that previously
  matched only `test` now also matches `Test` and `TEST`. API clients relying on exact-case matching
  via paginated endpoints will see additional results.

== Flotomatic

Flotomatic is a Rails wrapper around the flot javascript graphing library.

Flotomatic was originally developed for graphing migraine histories on http://MigraineLiving.com.

Known issues:
* Zooming in / out with overview plot only works after zooming in with the main plot one initial time
* When selecting datasets using the flot_selections div, the plot zoom is lost... it zooms all the way out

== Installation

To install the flotomatic plugin:

  script/plugin install git://github.com/xdotcommer/flotomatic.git

The following rake tasks are also available:
* rake  		# spec by default, runs specs
* rake rdoc  	# create documentation in rdoc folder
* rake install	# (re)copies the public javascript and stylesheet files - this is done automatically on install

== Example

Please note this is not intended to be a complete working an example.  It's purpose is only to illustrate some of what you can do through the API.  

It assumes a couple of collections have been created (@journals, @migraines) with very specific attributes on them.  For a working example see the walk through here:
http://xdotcommer.wordpress.com/2009/11/30/flotomatic-a-new-graphing-plugin-for-rails/

I've recently included a working example in the project under the example directory.  Just start up script/server in the example/ subdirectory and navigate to http://localhost:3000/flotomatic

=== Controller

  @flot = TimeFlot.new('graph') do |f|
    f.bars
    f.grid :hoverable => true
    f.selection :mode => "xy"
    f.filter {|collection| collection.select {|j| j.entry_date < Date.parse("7/8/2007")}}
    f.series_for("Stress", @journals, :x => :entry_date, :y => :stress_rating)
    f.series_for("Hours of Sleep", @migraines, :x => :entry_date, :y => :hours_of_sleep)
    f.series_for("Restful Night?", @migraines, :x => :entry_date, :y => lambda {|record| record.restful_night ? 5 : 0 }, :options => {:points => {:show => true}, :bars => {:show => false}})
    f.series_for("Migraines", @migraines, :x => :entry_date, :y => lambda {|record| record.migraine? ? 4 : nil }, :options => {:points => {:show => true}, :bars => {:show => false}})
  end

=== View

  <%= flot_includes %>

  <h2>Graph the following items</h2>

  <div class='flot_dataset_picker'>
  	<%= flot_selections %>
  </div>

  <h2>My Graph</h2>

  <%= flot_canvas("graph") %>

  <h2>Zoom In / Out</h2>

  <%= flot_overview("asdflkjasdf") %>

  <!-- do the actual plotting... -->
  <% flot_graph("graph", @flot) do %>
  	<%= flot_plot(:dynamic => true, :overview => true) %>
  	<%= flot_tooltip %>
  <% end %>

== Flotomatic Javascript Reference

Within the <% flot_graph %> block you will have access to the <tt>flotomatic</tt> variable.

The flotomatic variable is created with the id of the canvas div, the data, and options supplied through the Flot object passed in to the <tt>flot_graph</tt> call.  For instance:

  <% flot_graph("canvas", @flot) %> 

  // Results in the following:
  var flotomatic = new Flotomatic("canvas", @flot.data, @flot.options)

=== Flotomatic methods

Plotting Methods
  // actually draws the plot with $.plot
  draw: function(placeholder, data, initialOptions, ranges, dynamic, zoom)

  // calls draw & sets flotomatic.plot to the returned plot handle 
  graph: function(overview, dynamic)

  // dynamically graphs with choice input checkboxes for each dataset in flotomatic.data
  graphDynamic: function()

  // plots the overview (zoom in / out) graph
  graphOverview: function()

Tooltip Methods
  createTooltip: function(tooltipFormatter)

  // default tooltipFormatter
  tooltipFormatter: function(item) {
  	var date 	 = new Date(item.datapoint[0]),
  		label    = item.series.label;

  	return label + ": " + item.datapoint[1] + " on " + (date.getMonth() + 1) + "/" + date.getDate() + "</a>";
  }

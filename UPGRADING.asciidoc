Upgrading
=========

## From Graylog 1.x to 2.0.x

### Removed configuration settings

Some settings, which have been deprecated in previous versions, have finally
been removed from the Graylog configuration file.

.Removed configuration settings
|===
| Setting name       | Replacement

| `mongodb_host`     | `mongodb_uri`
| `mongodb_port`     | `mongodb_uri`
| `mongodb_database` | `mongodb_uri`
| `mongodb_useauth`  | `mongodb_uri`
| `mongodb_user`     | `mongodb_uri`
| `mongodb_password` | `mongodb_uri`
|===


### Changed configuration defaults

For better consistency, the defaults of some configuration settings have been
changed after the project has been renamed from _Graylog2_ to _Graylog_.

.Configuration defaults
|===
| Setting name                 | Old default                    | New default

| `elasticsearch_cluster_name` | `graylog2`                     | `graylog`
| `elasticsearch_node_name`    | `graylog2-server`              | `graylog-server`
| `elasticsearch_index_prefix` | `graylog2`                     | `graylog`
| `mongodb_uri`                | `mongodb://127.0.0.1/graylog2` | `mongodb://localhost/graylog`
|===


### Changed prefixes for configuration override

In the past it was possible to override configuration settings in Graylog using
environment variables or Java system properties with a specific prefix.

For better consistency, these prefixes have been changed after the project has
been renamed from _Graylog2_ to _Graylog_.

.Configuration override prefixes
|===
| Override                 | Old prefix       | New prefix | Example

| Environment variables | `GRAYLOG2_`        | `GRAYLOG_` | `GRAYLOG_IS_MASTER`
| System properties | `graylog2.`        | `graylog.` | `graylog.is_master`

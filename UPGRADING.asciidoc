Upgrading
=========

## From Graylog 1.x to 2.0.x

### Elasticsearch 2.x

The embedded Elasticsearch node being used by Graylog has been upgraded to Elasticsearch 2.x which includes some breaking changes.
Graylog 2.x does not work with Elasticsearch 1.x anymore and cannot communicate with existing Elasticsearch 1.x clusters.

Please see https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.0/breaking-changes.html[Breaking changes in Elasticsearch 2.x] for details.

The blog article https://www.elastic.co/blog/key-point-to-be-aware-of-when-upgrading-from-elasticsearch-1-to-2[Key points to be aware of when upgrading from Elasticsearch 1.x to 2.x] also contains interesting information about the upgrade path from Elasticsearch 1.x to 2.x.

#### Multicast Discovery

Multicast discovery has been removed from Elasticsearch 2.x (although it is still provided as an Elasticsearch plugin for now).

To reflect this change, the `elasticsearch_discovery_zen_ping_unicast_hosts` now has to contain the address of at least one Elasticsearch node in the cluster which Graylog can connect to.

#### Index range types

*This step needs to be performed before the update to Elasticsearch 2.x!*

Some Graylog versions stored meta information about indices in elasticsearch, alongside the messages themselves. Since Elasticsearch 2.0 having multiple types with conflicting mappings is no longer possible, which means that the `index_range` type must be removed before upgrading to Elasticsearch 2.3.1.

Find out if your setup is affected by running (replace `$elasticsearch` with the address of one of your Elasticsearch nodes)
`curl -XGET $elasticsearch:9200/_all/_mapping/index_range; echo`

If the output is `{}` you are not affected and can skip this step.

Otherwise, you need to delete the `index_range` type, Graylog does not use it anymore.

As Graylog sets older indices to read-only, first we need to remove the write block on those indices.
Since we'll be working with Elasticsearch's JSON output, we recommend installing the `jq` utility which should be available on all popular package managers or directly at https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[Github].

[source, bash]
----
for i in `curl -s -XGET $elasticsearch:9200/_all/_mapping/index_range | jq -r "keys[]"`
do
    echo -n "Updating index $i: "
    echo -n "curl -XPUT $elasticsearch:9200/$i/_settings -d '{\"index.blocks.read_only\":false, \"index.blocks.write\":false}' : "
    curl -XPUT $elasticsearch:9200/$i/_settings -d '{"index.blocks.read_only":false, "index.blocks.write":false}'
    echo
done
----

The output for each of the curl commands should be `{"acknowledged":true}`.
Next we have to delete the `index_range` mapping. We can perform this via the next command.

*We strongly recommend to perform this on a single index before running this bulk command.* This operation can be expensive to perform if you have a lot of affected indices.

[source, bash]
----
for i in `curl -s -XGET $elasticsearch:9200/_all/_mapping/index_range | jq -r "keys[]"`
do
    echo -n "Updating index $i: "
    curl -XDELETE $elasticsearch:9200/$i/index_range
    echo
done
----

It is not strictly necessary to set the indices back to read only, but if you prefer to do that, note the index names and commands during the first step and change the `false` into `true`.


#### Graylog Index Template

Graylog applies a custom https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.0/indices-templates.html[index template] to ensure that the indexed messages adhere to a specific schema.

Unfortunately the index template being used by Graylog 1.x is incompatible with Elasticsearch 2.x and has to be removed prior to upgrading.

In order to https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.0/indices-templates.html#delete[delete the index template] the following curl command has to be issued against on of the Elasticsearch nodes:

----
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:9200/_template/graylog-internal
----

Graylog will automatically create the new index template on the next startup.

#### Dots in field names

One of the most important breaking changes in Elasticsearch 2.x is that https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.0/breaking_20_mapping_changes.html#_field_names_may_not_contain_dots[field names may not contain dots] anymore.

Using the https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-migration[Elasticsearch Migration Plugin] might help to highlight some potential pitfalls if an existing Elasticsearch 1.x cluster should be upgraded to Elasticsearch 2.x.


### MongoDB

Graylog 2.x requires MongoDB 2.4 or newer. We recommend using MongoDB 3.x and the https://docs.mongodb.org/v3.2/core/wiredtiger/[WiredTiger storage engine].

When upgrading from MongoDB 2.0 or 2.2 to a supported version, make sure to read the https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/release-notes/[Release Notes] for the particular version.


### Log4j 2 migration

Graylog switched its logging backend from https://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/[Log4j 1.2] to https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/[Log4j 2].

Please refer to the https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/migration.html[Log4j Migration Guide] for information on how to update your existing logging configuration.


### Dead Letters feature removed

The Dead Letters feature, which stored messages that couldn't be indexed into Elasticsearch for various reasons, has been removed.

This feature has been disabled by default. If you have enabled the feature the configuration file, please check the `dead_letters_enabled` collection in MongoDB and remove it afterwards.


### Removed configuration settings

#### Index Retention and Rotation Settings

In 2.0.0 the index rotation and retention settings have been moved from the Graylog server config file to the database and are
now configurable via the web interface.

The old settings from the `graylog.conf` or `/etc/graylog/server/server.conf` will be migrated to the database.

WARNING: When you upgrade from a 1.x version and you modified any rotation/retention settings, please make sure you **KEEP** your old settings in the config file so the migration process will add your old settings to the database! Otherwise the retention process will use the default settings and might remove a lot of indices.

#### Overview

Some settings, which have been deprecated in previous versions, have finally been removed from the Graylog configuration file.

### Changed configuration defaults

For better consistency, the defaults of some configuration settings have been changed after the project has been renamed from _Graylog2_ to _Graylog_.

.Configuration defaults
|===
| Setting name                                         | Old default                    | New default

| `elasticsearch_cluster_name`                         | `graylog2`                     | `graylog`
| `elasticsearch_node_name`                            | `graylog2-server`              | `graylog-server`
| `elasticsearch_index_prefix`                         | `graylog2`                     | `graylog`
| `elasticsearch_discovery_zen_ping_unicast_hosts`     | empty                          | `127.0.0.1:9300`
| `elasticsearch_discovery_zen_ping_multicast_enabled` | `true`                         | `false`
| `mongodb_uri`                                        | `mongodb://127.0.0.1/graylog2` | `mongodb://localhost/graylog`
|===


### Changed prefixes for configuration override

In the past it was possible to override configuration settings in Graylog using environment variables or Java system properties with a specific prefix.

For better consistency, these prefixes have been changed after the project has been renamed from _Graylog2_ to _Graylog_.

.Configuration override prefixes
|===
| Override              | Old prefix  | New prefix | Example

| Environment variables | `GRAYLOG2_` | `GRAYLOG_` | `GRAYLOG_IS_MASTER`
| System properties     | `graylog2.` | `graylog.` | `graylog.is_master`
|===

### REST API Changes

The output ID key for the list of outputs in the `/streams/*` endpoints has been changed from `_id` to `id`.

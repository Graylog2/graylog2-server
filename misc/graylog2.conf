# Graylog2 uses an internal message queue that holds all received messages until they are indexed. The mq_batch_size parameter defines how many messages are sent
# to ElasticSearch at once (using a _bulk update: http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/bulk.html). The mq_poll_freq parameter controls in which
# interval (in seconds) the message batch is sent. Example: If you leave the standard values (mq_batch_size = 4000, mq_poll_freq = 1), Graylog2 will index 4000 messages
# every second. If you have spikes with more than 4000 messages per second, the queue will start growing until you get under 4000 messages/second again. The queue is
# FIFO and can grow until you run out of RAM. Note that the queue *only* resists in RAM, so if you set the mq_poll_freq to a high value, you may lose a lot of not yet
# indexed messages when the server crashes. Run the server in debug mode (java -jar graylog2-server.jar --debug) with a |grep '^INFO' to see debug information about
# the queue and it's size. (INFO : org.graylog2.periodical.BulkIndexerThread - About to index max 4000 messages. You have a total of 103 messages in the queue. [freq:1s])
# You can also monitor the queue size in your graylog2-web-interface.

## Upstart script

Simple upstart script for start/stopping graylog2-server.  
Place this in /etc/init and graylog2-server will start upon bootup.  
It can also be stopped or started manually by issuing the following commands.

    start graylog2-server
    stop graylog2-server

You can test if it is running or not with the following command

    status graylog2-server

Tested on Ubuntu Lucid.

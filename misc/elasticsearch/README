Simple set of script to help work with elasticsearch

-- reallocate_shards.sh

when for any reason your cluster fails or what ever happens to it starts with a lot of
shard in unassigned state, you can use this script to force allocation on nodes.
Difference between of waiting and using this can be few minutes to few hours of cluster not
be in usable state...

-- set_index_writable.sh

By default graylog will set index to non writable state after cycling to next index
This script will connect to elasticsearch node and set given index to writable state.


-- remove_from_index.sh

After using set_index_writable.sh you can now use this to query index and delete specific stuff
from you elasticsearch index, of course because it can be used to delete almost everything from
your elasticsearch index. You must edit it every time you need to delete something specific to
minimize that chance :)

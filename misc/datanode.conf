# GRAYLOG DATANODE CONFIGURATION FILE
#####################################
#
# This is the Graylog DataNode configuration file. The file has to use ISO 8859-1/Latin-1 character encoding.
# Characters that cannot be directly represented in this encoding can be written using Unicode escapes
# as defined in https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-3.html#jls-3.3, using the \u prefix.
# For example, \u002c.
#
# * Entries are generally expected to be a single line of the form, one of the following:
#
# propertyName=propertyValue
# propertyName:propertyValue
#
# * White space that appears between the property name and property value is ignored,
#   so the following are equivalent:
#
# name=Stephen
# name = Stephen
#
# * White space at the beginning of the line is also ignored.
#
# * Lines that start with the comment characters ! or # are ignored. Blank lines are also ignored.
#
# * The property value is generally terminated by the end of the line. White space following the
#   property value is not ignored, and is treated as part of the property value.
#
# * A property value can span several lines if each line is terminated by a backslash (‘\’) character.
#   For example:
#
# targetCities=\
#         Detroit,\
#         Chicago,\
#         Los Angeles
#
#   This is equivalent to targetCities=Detroit,Chicago,Los Angeles (white space at the beginning of lines is ignored).
#
# * The characters newline, carriage return, and tab can be inserted with characters \n, \r, and \t, respectively.
#
# * The backslash character must be escaped as a double backslash. For example:
#
# path=c:\\docs\\doc1
#

# The auto-generated node ID will be stored in this file and read after restarts. It is a good idea
# to use an absolute file path here if you are starting Graylog DataNode from init scripts or similar.
node_id_file = data/node-id

# location of your data-node configuration files - put additional files like manually created certificates etc. here
config_location = /etc/graylog/datanode

# You MUST set a secret to secure/pepper the stored user passwords here. Use at least 64 characters.
# Generate one by using for example: pwgen -N 1 -s 96
# ATTENTION: This value must be the same on all Graylog and Datanode nodes in the cluster.
# Changing this value after installation will render all user sessions and encrypted values in the database invalid. (e.g. encrypted access tokens)
password_secret =

# The default root user is named 'admin'
#root_username = admin

# You MUST specify a hash password for the root user (which you only need to initially set up the
# system and in case you lose connectivity to your authentication backend)
# This password cannot be changed using the API or via the web interface. If you need to change it,
# modify it in this file.
# Create one by using for example: echo -n yourpassword | sha256sum
# and put the resulting hash value into the following line

# connection to MongoDB, shared with the Graylog server

#### HTTP bind address
#
# The network interface used by the Graylog DataNode to bind all services.
#
# bind_address = 0.0.0.0

#### Hostname
#
# if you need to specify the hostname to use (because looking it up programmatically gives wrong results)
# hostname =

#### HTTP port
#
# The port where the DataNode REST api is listening
#
# datanode_http_port = 8999

#### HTTP publish URI
#
# This configuration should be used if you want to connect to this Graylog DataNode's REST API and it is available on
# another network interface than $http_bind_address,
# for example if the machine has multiple network interfaces or is behind a NAT gateway.
# http_publish_uri =

#### OpenSearch HTTP port
#
# The port where OpenSearch HTTP is listening on
#
# opensearch_http_port = 9200

#### OpenSearch transport port
#
# The port where OpenSearch transports is listening on
#
# opensearch_transport_port = 9300

#### OpenSearch node name config option
#
# use this, if your node name should be different from the hostname that's found by programmatically looking it up
#
# node_name =

#### OpenSearch discovery_seed_hosts config option
#
# if you're not using the automatic data node setup and want to create a cluster, you have to setup the discovery seed hosts
#
# opensearch_discovery_seed_hosts =

#### OpenSearch initial_manager_nodes config option
#
# if you're not using the automatic data node setup and want to create a cluster, you have to setup the initial manager nodes
# make sure to remove this setting after the cluster has formed
#
# initial_cluster_manager_nodes =

#### OpenSearch folders
#
# set these if you need OpenSearch to be located in a special place or want to include an existing version
#
# Root directory of the used opensearch distribution
# opensearch_location = dist/
#
# opensearch_config_location = config
# opensearch_data_location = data
# opensearch_logs_location = logs

#### OpenSearch Certificate bundles for transport and http layer security
#
# if you're not using the automatic data node setup, you can manually configure your SSL certificates
# transport_certificate = datanode-transport-certificates.p12
# transport_certificate_password = password
# http_certificate = datanode-http-certificates.p12
# http_certificate_password = password

#### OpenSearch log buffers size
#
# the number of lines from stderr and stdout of the OpenSearch process that are buffered inside the DataNode for logging etc.
#
# process_logs_buffer_size = 500

#### OpenSearch JWT token usage
#
# communication between Graylog and OpenSearch is secured by JWT. These are the defaults used for the token usage
# adjust them, if you have special needs.
#
# indexer_jwt_auth_token_caching_duration = 60s
# indexer_jwt_auth_token_expiration_duration = 180s

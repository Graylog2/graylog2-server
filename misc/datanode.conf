# GRAYLOG DATANODE CONFIGURATION FILE
#####################################
#
# This is the Graylog DataNode configuration file. The file has to use ISO 8859-1/Latin-1 character encoding.
# Characters that cannot be directly represented in this encoding can be written using Unicode escapes
# as defined in https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-3.html#jls-3.3, using the \u prefix.
# For example, \u002c.
#
# * Entries are generally expected to be a single line of the form, one of the following:
#
# propertyName=propertyValue
# propertyName:propertyValue
#
# * White space that appears between the property name and property value is ignored,
#   so the following are equivalent:
#
# name=Stephen
# name = Stephen
#
# * White space at the beginning of the line is also ignored.
#
# * Lines that start with the comment characters ! or # are ignored. Blank lines are also ignored.
#
# * The property value is generally terminated by the end of the line. White space following the
#   property value is not ignored, and is treated as part of the property value.
#
# * A property value can span several lines if each line is terminated by a backslash (‘\’) character.
#   For example:
#
# targetCities=\
#         Detroit,\
#         Chicago,\
#         Los Angeles
#
#   This is equivalent to targetCities=Detroit,Chicago,Los Angeles (white space at the beginning of lines is ignored).
#
# * The characters newline, carriage return, and tab can be inserted with characters \n, \r, and \t, respectively.
#
# * The backslash character must be escaped as a double backslash. For example:
#
# path=c:\\docs\\doc1
#

# Root directory of opensearch distribution
opensearch_location = dist/

# data-node config location
config_location = /etc/graylog/datanode

# locations of opensearch bin, data and log directories 
opensearch_config_location = config
opensearch_data_location = data
opensearch_logs_location = logs

# to use an absolute file path here if you are starting Graylog DataNode from init scripts or similar.

# You MUST set a secret to secure/pepper the stored user passwords here. Use at least 64 characters.
# Generate one by using for example: pwgen -N 1 -s 96
# ATTENTION: This value must be the same on all Graylog and Datanode nodes in the cluster.
# Changing this value after installation will render all user sessions and encrypted values in the database invalid. (e.g. encrypted access tokens)

#root_username = admin

# You MUST specify a hash password for the root user (which you only need to initially set up the
# system and in case you lose connectivity to your authentication backend)
# This password cannot be changed using the API or via the web interface. If you need to change it,
# modify it in this file.
# Create one by using for example: echo -n yourpassword | shasum -a 256
# and put the resulting hash value into the following line

NetFlow Plugin for Graylog
==========================

This plugin provides a NetFlow UDP input to act as a Flow collector that receives data from Flow exporters. Each received Flow will be converted to a Graylog message.

**Required Graylog version:** 2.3.0 and later

## Supported NetFlow Versions

The version of the plugin now supports NetFlow V9.  It can support IPv6 addresses without 
conversion and handles all of the fields from the fixed V5 format.  In addition this plugin supports
events from a CISCO ASA 5500, including firewall and routing events.  Beware, there is significant
duplication of typical syslog reporting in the v9 reporting. 

## Installation
> Since Graylog Version 2.4.0 this plugin is already included in the Graylog server installation package as default plugin.

[Download the plugin](https://github.com/Graylog2/graylog-plugin-netflow/releases)
and place the `.jar` file in your Graylog plugin directory. The plugin directory
is the `plugins/` folder relative from your `graylog-server` directory by default
and can be configured in your `graylog.conf` file.

Restart `graylog-server` and you are done.

## Setup

In the Graylog web interface, go to System/Inputs and create a new NetFlow input like this:

## Credits

The NetFlow parsing code is based on the https://github.com/wasted/netflow project and has been ported from Scala to Java.

### Testing

To generate some NetFlow data for debugging and testing you can use softflowd.

Example command and output:

```
# softflowd -D -i eth0 -v 5 -t maxlife=1 -n 10.0.2.2:2055

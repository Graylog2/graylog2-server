# Entries are generally expected to be a single line of the form, one of the following:
#
# groupName.propertyName=propertyValue
#
# White space that appears between the property name and property value is ignored,
# so the following are equivalent:
#
# test.name=Stephen
# test.name = Stephen
#
# White space at the beginning of the line is also ignored.
# Lines that start with the comment characters ! or # are ignored. Blank lines are also ignored.
# The property value is generally terminated by the end of the line. White space following the
# property value is not ignored, and is treated as part of the property value.

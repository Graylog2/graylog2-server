<#if _title>Data Node version mismatch</#if>

<#if _description><
    You are running at least one Data Node which runs on a different version than your server.
    While this might not impose a problem, it is recommended to run server and Data Nodes on the same version.
    For instructions on how to upgrade your data nodes, please go to the Data Node upgrade page found in
    System/Cluster Configuration menu.

The history is scoped by user and sorted chronologically. The history contains all queries executed on the search page, dashboards and dashboard widgets.
It can be opened by clicking on the history icon or by pressing the keyboard shortcut alt+shift+h.

While it is open, it can be filtered using the query input. When a previous query has been selected, it will replace the current value of the query input.

With this change we are also removing the keyboard shortcuts ctrl+space and ctrl+shift+space to manually display the suggestions.
It is still possible to display the suggestions by pressing alt+space.

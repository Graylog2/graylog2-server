        It looks like you are starting Graylog for the first time and have not configured a data node.<br />
        Data nodes allow you to index and search through all the messages in your Graylog message database.
      </P>
      <P>
        You can either implement a <DocumentationLink page="" text="Graylog data node" /> (recommended) or you can configure an <DocumentationLink page="" text="Elasticsearch" /> or <DocumentationLink page="" text="OpenSearch" /> node manually.

      <P>
        If you want to configure an Elasticsearch or OpenSearch node manually, you need to adjust the Graylog configuration and restart the Graylog server.
        After the restart this page will not show up again.

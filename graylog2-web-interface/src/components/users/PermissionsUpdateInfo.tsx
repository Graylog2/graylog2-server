        With Graylog 4.0, we&apos;ve updated the permissions system. Granting permissions for an entity like streams and dashboards is no longer part of the user edit page.
        It can now be configured using the <b><Icon name="user-plus" /> Share</b> button of an entity. You can find the button e.g. on the entities overview page. Learn more in the <DocumentationLink page={DocsHelper.PAGES.PERMISSIONS} text="documentation" />.

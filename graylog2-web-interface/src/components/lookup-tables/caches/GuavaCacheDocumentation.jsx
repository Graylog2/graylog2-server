        The cache will remove entries after a fixed time since they have been used the last time.<br />
        This results in the cache behaving as a space limited least recently used cache.

        The cache will remove entries after a fixed time since they have been entered into the cache.<br />
        This results in entries that are never older than the given time, which can be important for
        regularly changing data, such as configuration state of external systems.

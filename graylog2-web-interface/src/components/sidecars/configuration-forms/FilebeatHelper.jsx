        <b>paths</b><br/>
        Paths that should be crawled and fetched. Glob based paths.
        To fetch all &quot;.log&quot; files from a specific level of subdirectories
        For each file found under this path, a harvester is started.
        Make sure not file is defined twice as this can lead to unexpected behaviour.
        {this.example(`paths:
  - /var/log/*.log
  - c:\\programdata\\elasticsearch\\logs\\*`)}

        <b>encoding</b><br/>
        Configure the file encoding for reading files with international characters.

        <b>exclude_lines</b><br/>
        A list of regular expressions to match. It drops the lines that are
        matching any regular expression from the list. The include_lines is called before
        exclude_lines.
        {this.example(`exclude_lines: ['^DBG']`)}

        <b>include_lines</b><br/>
        A list of regular expressions to match. It exports the lines that are
        matching any regular expression from the list. The include_lines is called before
        exclude_lines.
        {this.example(`include_lines: ['^ERR', '^WARN']`)}

        <b>exclude_files</b><br/>
        Exclude files. A list of regular expressions to match. Filebeat drops the files that
        are matching any regular expression from the list.
        {this.example(`exclude_files: ['.gz$']`)}

        <b>fields</b><br/>
        Optional additional fields. These fields can be freely picked
        to add additional information to the crawled log files for filtering.

  level: debug
  review: 1`)}

        <b>fields_under_root</b><br/>
        Set to true to store the additional fields as top level fields instead
        of under the &quot;fields&quot; sub-dictionary.

        How often the prospector checks for new files in the paths that are specified
        for harvesting.
        {this.example(`scan_frequency: 10s`)}

        <b>multiline.pattern</b><br/>
        Mutiline can be used for log messages spanning multiple lines. This is common
        for Java Stack Traces or C-Line Continuation. The regexp Pattern that has to be matched.
        {this.example(`multiline.pattern: ^\\[`)}

        <b>multiline.negate</b><br/>
        Defines if the pattern set under pattern should be negated or not.

        <b>multiline.match</b><br/>
        Match can be set to &quot;after&quot; or &quot;before&quot;. It is used to define if lines should be append to a pattern
        that was (not) matched before or after or as long as a pattern is not matched based on negate.
        {this.example(`multiline.match: after`)}

        <b>close_inactive</b><br/>
        Closes the file handler after the predefined period.
        The period starts when the last line of the file was, not the file ModTime.
        {this.example(`close_inactive: 5m`)}

        <b>clean_inactive</b><br/>
        Files for the modification data is older then clean_inactive the state from the registry is removed.

### Welcome to the Graylog UI documentation!

Our UI documentation provides a collection of our UI and UX guidelines. It also provides gallery of shared components
that you can use when writing frontend code. You can find an overview of our frontend code conventions in the [`CONTRUBUTING.md`](https://github.com/Graylog2/graylog2-server/blob/master/graylog2-web-interface/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Please take your time to read through these documents and make sure you follow our guidelines.

This document not complete, but we will do our best to make it our to-go reference when writing frontend code.
If you encounter a shared component or a best practice which has not been documented, please extend the documentation.
We all benefit from documenting our processes and components, as it help us to use them without expending too much time
reading at the source code, and also to think twice about how we solved a certain problem.

### Welcome to the Graylog UI documentation!

In this page we describe our processes to write frontend code. We also
offer a gallery of shared components that you can use when writing frontend
code for the Graylog web interface or one of our frontend plugins.

Please take your time to read through this document and make sure you follow
our guidelines. Otherwise your changes may not be merged into our repositories
until you do.

This document is still in a very early stage, but we will do our best to
make it our to-go reference when writing frontend code.

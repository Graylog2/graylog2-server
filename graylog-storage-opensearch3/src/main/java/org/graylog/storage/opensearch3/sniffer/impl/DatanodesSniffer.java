/**
 * This is an implementation of a {@link NodesSniffer} which provides hostnames of datanodes available in the
 * datanode {@link NodeService} collection. By using this sniffer, opensearch clients can recover and start using
 * opensearch inside datanode even if we heavily reconfigure the cluster topology - by stopping and starting nodes,
 * changing their hostnames(and certificates), by adding and removing nodes. Opensearch clients will always get
 * all available nodes through this sniffer. This also helps to spread the load in the cluster, as all of those
 * nodes can be used by the client, not just those initially configured.
